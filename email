Dear everyone,

I received a few questions that I think everyone would benefit from.

General comments on code 
- Comment the code so that we know what’s going on.
- Keep the code as clean as possible. If you take code from online sources, make sure it integrates well with your code.
- Give your GitHub a structure (with folders with clear names and/or a ReadMe).

Final presentation
5 slides = 5 main messages. Be clear-eyed about what you want to communicate as you don’t have many slides to do so. Once you start working with the code, it should become clearer.

The form of the final presentation is not yet known. Once we know more about the future corona situation, we can give you more information.

Some tips on working in teams
Everyone in the group has deadlines and priorities that they need to balance. Here are some tips that can facilitate remote teamwork:
- Familiarises yourself with the projects individually, come up with a gameplan, and then have a Skype call AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to coordinate the team. 
- Discuss in which directions you think you can take the project. 
- Discuss who is responsible for what—play to your strengths or choose something that interests you. Everyone is expected to contribute to the code. 
- Discuss timelines and manage expectations—ultimately you will be graded as a team. If you have some conflicts, communicate them early on. 
- Schedule another meeting to touch base and discuss progress.
- Agree upon an official communication channel.
- Be responsive to your team.

If you do these in your first meeting, then everyone can work independently at their preferred pace.

Individual assignments
We will only give you the individual assignments after the group project. Hopefully, this helps with the workload. Expect the projects to take 1-2 days to complete.

Asking questions
If you have any administrative questions or questions that are not specific to your group, post them in the Admin folder in the OLAT forum.

I hope this was helpful.

Looking forward to your final projects.

Luca
